# Punishment and Deterrence: Replication of Drunk Driving Study

## Description
This repository contains data and Python code developed to replicate the findings of Benjamin Hansen's 2015 study, "Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence from Drunk Driving," published in the American Economic Review. The original study examines the effects of stricter punishments on reducing recidivism among drunk drivers, using regression discontinuity design. The analysis is based on a rich dataset of over 500,000 DUI stops in Washington State, exploring whether increased sanctions at blood alcohol content (BAC) thresholds effectively reduce repeat drunk driving offenses.
